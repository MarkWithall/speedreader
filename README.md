speedreader
===========

A bookmarklet to speed read webpages in the style of the [Read Quick](http://readquickapp.com/) iPad app.

Bookmarklet is available from [here](http://markwithall.github.com/speedreader/).

To use: select some text and then click the bookmark.

Tested in Safari and Chrome.

Future Work
==
* Cancel reading (leave last word read highlighted?)
* Configurable wpm
* Read whole page if no text selected
* Remember scrollbar position, selected text
* Needs to clear the style (to cope with e.g. black backgrounds, alternate alignments, etc.)
* Make it prettier (configurable font, size, colours, etc.)
* Don't keep re-creating script if running multiple times on the same page
* Make updating version (that references a js file here, rather than inline)
* Test cross-browser compatibility
* Tidy code
