Speed Reader
===========

A bookmarklet to speed read webpages in the style of the [Read Quick](http://readquickapp.com/) iPad app.

Bookmarklet is available from [here](http://markwithall.github.com/speedreader/).

To use: select some text and then click the bookmark.

Tested in the latest versions of Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Opera and IE.

Future Work
==
* Make it prettier (configurable font, size, colours, etc.)
* Have bookmarklet generator where one specifies speed, font, etc.
* Test cross-browser compatibility (automatic test suite that can be run on different browsers)
